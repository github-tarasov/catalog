Preconditions: book catalog is stored in DB and DB size is big. It also uses several tables to store all book information. Quick response is the main requirements.

#Task:

Think about it as task with 300 line of code with unlimited budget.

#Implementation:
RESTful Web Service specification JAX-RS 2.0 and JPA 2.1 using RESTEasy 3, jackson 2, Hibernate 4.3, Derby, jUnit.
